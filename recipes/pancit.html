<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pancit is a type of Filipino noodle dish. The noodles may vary depending on the kind of pancit recipe being prepared. For example, this recipe makes use of rice noodles called bihon. Flour sticks or noodle is also used to make pancit canton, pancit habhab, and pancit bato.</p>

    <p>The chicken meat that I used from this pancit recipe was from the leg quarters. I use chicken leg quarters most of the time for dishes such as this because it is cheaper and tasty too. I started by boiling the chicken in water. This process totally cooked the chicken and made it tender. As a bonus, chicken stock was produced in the process. This means that we saved more money because we do not need to buy chicken stock to make our pancit.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 lbs. chicken with bones and skin on</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. bihon noodles rice sticks</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. sotanghon noodles green bean thread</li>
        <li>1/2 piece cabbage chopped</li>
        <li>2 piece carrots julienne</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup flat leaf parsley chopped</li>
        <li>1 piece onion sliced</li>
        <li>3 stalk celery or celery heart, chopped</li>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour 6 cups of water in a cooking pot. Let boil. Put-in the chicken and boil for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the boiled chicken from the cooking pot. Let it cool down. Shred the meat and discard the bones. Set aside. Note: do not throw the water yet, we will use it later as chicken stock.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, soak the sotanghon and bihon noodles in water for 10 minutes. Set aside. Note: do this by using a large mixing bowl and fill it with tap water.</li>
        <li>Heat a large pan. Pour-in 2 tablespoons cooking oil.</li>
        <li>Let the oil get hot then stir-fry the cabbage and carrots for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>On the same pan, heat the remaining cooking oil. Once the oil becomes smoking hot, saute the onion, celery, and garlic.</li>
        <li>Add the ground black pepper and shredded chicken. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour-in soy sauce and 1 cup of chicken stock (this is the water that was used to boil the chicken). Stir and let boil. Cook for 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add the soaked noodles. Toss the noodles until all the ingredients are well blended. If the noodles is somewhat dry, add a cup of chicken stock and continue to toss until the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li>Put-in the stir-fried cabbage and carrots. Toss.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving plate. Serve with lemon or calamansi.</li>
